        <p>
	After a long career in Public Relations in New York, I returned to my native Rochester, NY in 2003 to study design and furniture making at RIT's School for American Crafts.  There I studied under Wendell Castle and many of the best exemplars of the Studio Furniture movement, leading me to a somewhat sculptural, if still traditional, approach to furniture design.  In my furniture, I prefer to work in the self sustaining species found on our nearby Allegheny plateau (cherry, walnut, oak, ash, poplar), but still find a place for more exotic species where appropriate.  I draw inspiration equally from historical furniture forms and other interestingly shaped objects I run across. I have designed tables with 18th century hipped legs, and tables with legs mimicking ceramic power line insulators, for example.  A strict purist when it comes to tools, I try to use the right tool for the job.  That is to say I'm equally likely to cut joinery with chisel and mallet and a bas relief with a CNC controlled router.  As technology has expanded what is possible in the working of wood, what I choose to do with wood has expanded concomitantly.

In addition to furniture design, I have turned in recent years to lutherie.  I now make a small number of ukuleles a year, under the brand name Railroad Street Ukuleles.  Each uke is unique in its details of decoration, but built on the principle of spherical section, pioneered by American luthiers in the late 20th century (making American guitars substantially different from their European forebears).  I work primarily in the tone woods of Honduras Mahagony, Sapele, and Koa for bodies and necks and Spruce and Cedar for tops.  I use both traditional decoration (mother of pearl inlay) and more modern techniques (colored resin inlay).  My ukes are primarily tenor size, but a line of concert size is in the works.

KPR Design has its home in a studio on Railroad Street in Rochester, NY, a scant block from the wonderful Rochester Public Market.  The neighborhood is lively, the food at the market interesting, the community of artists in the vicinity varied and always helpful to each other.  In short, it's the perfect situation in which to pursue my craft.
